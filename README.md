Write global and local electrophilicity properties from NBO Charges.

Usage:

python write_electro_nbo.py -p path/to/<filename>.log

path/to/filename.log should be supplied relative to the position of
write_electro_properties.py script.

Output (in the same folder as <filename>.log):

path/to/<filname>_electro.csv

In the example I've used for reference, "<filename>" is "thiazole".
